    "overview of how to use one tool that can be helpful with digital texts, especially longer ones. This is an online tool called [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/). This tool can be used to analyze word occurances, frequencies, and contexts of terms in a given digital text. This can be helpful in comparing findings to Gazetteers and TF-IDF analyses as well as getting a visual representation of a lot of numbers and terms. While the texts do have to be computer readable, it is still an interesting way to get a lot of information quickly and simply in order to aid your reasearch terms and analyses."

    "In order to take advantage of this tool, it is necessary to have a text that you want to analyze. For the purpose of thisl lesson, I will use Julius Caesar's *De Bello Gallico*, or *The Gallic Wars*, as an example. In this case I copied the text from a [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10657/pg10657-images.html) upload of the text. While I could have copied the link to the entire text, I chose to copy and paste the exact text I wanted so that I did not get extra information from the appendices. It is necessary to either copy the link to the entire text you wish to analyze\n",
