    "There are lots of different ways to engage with texts in textual and historical analysis. In this lesson, we will go over a basic \n",
    "overview of how to use one tool that can be helpful with digital texts, especially longer ones. This is an online tool called [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/). This tool can be used to analyze word occurances, frequencies, and contexts of terms in a given digital text. This can be helpful in comparing findings to Gazetteers and TF-IDF analyses as well as getting a visual representation of a lot of numbers and terms. While the texts do have to be computer readable, it is still an interesting way to get a lot of information quickly and simply in order to aid your reasearch terms and analyses."

    "In order to take advantage of this tool, it is necessary to have a text that you want to analyze. For the purpose of thisl lesson, I will use Julius Caesar's *De Bello Gallico*, or *The Gallic Wars*, as an example. In this case I copied the text from a [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10657/pg10657-images.html) upload of the text. While I could have copied the link to the entire text, I chose to copy and paste the exact text I wanted so that I did not get extra information from the appendices. It is necessary to either copy the link to the entire text you wish to analyze\n",

This is a clear, visual way to see which words are the most common,. It is not, however, where you would look for exact numbers or context. In this case, it is clear that 'Caesar' is the most common word, and words such as 'winter' and 'aedui' are likely still common, but a lot less common than 'Caesar'.\n",

This is definitely a way to see the exact numbers of each word, but there is no context, and is not ncessarily as easy to see the comparison between words within the text. In this instance, it is clear that 'Caesar,' 'having,' and 'enemy' are the three most common words, along side their exact counts.</p>\n",

In this example, it shows how the three terms from the previous section connect to other terms in the text. If you hover over one of the terms, then it shows which words it is connected to.\n",

This is one of the best sections to look at both an easy visual as well as exact numbers and context. In this instance we can see that 'gaul' is mentioned 190 times, and that is connected to the words in the bubbles highlighted in red. The number in the red bubble represents how many times the words are near each other.</p>\n",

While this is some what helpful because it shows the distribution of the common words throughough the text, the divisions are just based on an even division of the text. It would work any better if you had multiple texts, as it would show the distributions of the words across separate books. This is a really good tool for comparison and analysis because it provides an easy visual for the distribution of commanality for a specific term.</p>\n",

This is important because it shows the context of the common words. Context is really important when analyzing word frequencies because it gives meaning to the word. It also shows potential connections with other common words. While the visual may not be quite as easy to look at as some of the previous other sections, it is equally important because it shows a balanced picture of how the term fits into the text each time it occurs.</p>\n",

    "## Textual and Historical Analysis in Action\n",
    "Over the course of this lesson we have worked through how to upload text files to voyant as well as the diffent anlysis features and how they may be used. By using *Gallic Wars* as an example text, we were able to look at the features more clearly. By using Voyant, instead of just TF-IDF, NLPs and APIs, we are able to see not only that Caesar is one of the most common words of the text, but alsohow it interacts with the words around it. Voyant also allows for context to be given for each instance of the word, which is something that is hard to represent in other forms, such as a gazetteer, as well as how the terms relate to each other. This all can be valuable information when looking to analyze a text for its textual and historical significance."
